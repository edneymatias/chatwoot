# Specification Quality Checklist: Stage Transition Rules

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-01

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Source material (`docs/kanban/ciclo 2/03-stage-transition-rules/spec7.md`) already resolved the
  open questions from the original placeholder (opportunity-level vs. conversation-level fields;
  frontend pre-check vs. backend enforcement) — this spec restates those decisions in
  business/testable terms without re-opening them, so no clarification markers were needed.
